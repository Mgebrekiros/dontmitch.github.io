<a name="who-i-am" class="anchor" href="#who-i-am"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who I am</h3>

<p>My name is Mitch, and I'm a mechanical engineer turned full stack web developer. You can read a bit more about me on my <a href="http://mitchjlee.com" target="_blank">homepage</a>, but here's the abridged version:</p>

<p>I love learning. More than anything else, that's what I'm passionate about. I am constantly trying to expand on my abilities or develop new ones. I enjoy reading - especially about tech news - and tend to not watch TV - excluding sports - for the sole reason that I'd rather be learning new things. I wholeheartedly embrace my inner engineer and can geek out with the best of them.</p>

<p>Now that I've graduated from Dev Bootcamp's first Chicago cohort, I'd love nothing more than to continue my learning at a quality company, preferably 37signals.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-i-bring" class="anchor" href="#what-i-bring"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I bring</h3>

<p>If there's one thing I know, it's that 37signals is on the top of most people's dream-job list. People don't do <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2709-sites-that-landed-jobs-at-37signals" target="_blank">this</a> for just any company... So why is it that I think I can be considered for a position there?</p>

<p>First and foremost, although I'm new to the industry, I have been formally trained as an engineer. I graduated from Northwestern University at the top of my class. At face value, that means nothing more than that I was good at school, but I choose to interpret it as meaning that I have the mindset of an engineer and a killer work ethic.</p>

<p>Second, I am great at knowing when I don't know something, admitting to that fact, and seeking out help. In short, I thrive on the greatness of others. This is coincidentally the reason I want to work at 37signals so badly - the opportunity to join the 37signals team is what draws me there above all else.</p>

<p>Third, I learn quickly. I encourage you to continue reading with this fact in mind: I have been formally trained as a web developer for just nine weeks. I have another three weeks of formal training ahead of me and fully except to continue learning at the same pace that I learned at these past nine weeks.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-ive-done" class="anchor" href="#what-ive-done"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I've done</h3>

<p>You can see all of my work on my <a href="https://github.com/dontmitch" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>, but here are three projects that I'd like to highlight:</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/dontmitch/group_planning" target="_blank">grouPACT</a></h4>
<p>This was the longest project that I've worked on to date, spanning eight days with two team members. It's a Rails-backed web application featuring some advanced algorithms run as background jobs, mailer integration and Stripe authentication and payment processing. We made heavy use of GitHub for version control (we had well over 500 commits and 150 feature branches at the end), Asana for group planning and task management, and RSpec and Capybara testing for quality control.</p>

<p>You can find the live site at <a href="http://groupact.me" target="_blank">grouPACT.me</a> and can view the full source code <a href="https://github.com/dontmitch/group_planning" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The code is by no means perfect but is hopefully an indication of how far I've come over the past few weeks. As a sidenote, I learned Rails a week and half before starting this project.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/dontmitch/web_flash_cards" target="_blank">Flash Cards</a></h4>

<p>This is a Sinatra-backed flashcard application that I built after two weeks of JavaScript, jQuery, CSS and HTML instruction. The project took me the better part of a weekend and was a great learning experience. You can see a working version on heroku <a href="http://platypuscards.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and the source code <a href="https://github.com/dontmitch/web_flash_cards" target="_blank">here</a>. Some of the basic features include: secure password handling using BCrypt, redirect backs using session cookies, AJAX calls, advanced CSS animations, and custom layouts (no bootstrap here). I purposefully haven't cleaned up the code to allow for an accurate gauge of my skill level at that point in time.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/dontmitch/intro_to_rails" target="_blank">Intro to Rails</a></h4>

<p>Shortly after being introduced to Rails myself, I decided to capture my onboarding experience while it was still fresh in my mind by writing my own beginner's guide to Rails. My hope is that future boots will find it useful leading up to their transition from Sinatra to Rails. The readme should explain how to use the guide, but it is worth noting that this is still largely a work in progress.</p>

<h3>
<a name="whats-next" class="anchor" href="#whats-next"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's next?</h3>

<p>I really want to work for 37signals. I'd love to tell you why over email, by phone, or (preferably) in person. I won't waste your time, and I will do my best to show you why I'm so passionate about programming. You can reach me via any or all of the methods below.</p>
