<p>My name is Mitch, and I used to be a mechanical engineer. At least, that was what I formally studied in college and - for two short years - practiced at Boeing Defense.</p>

<p>Now, I am a recent graduate of Dev Bootcamp hoping to make a splash as a developer. How did I get from point A to point B you ask? Read onâ€¦</p>

<h3>
<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I was fortunate enough to know from a young age that I wanted to be an engineer; the engineering way of thinking came naturally to me. What I didn't know was what type of engineer I wanted to be. When push came to shove, I chose mechanical engineering because it was the most noncommittal.</p>

<p>Truth be told, what I really enjoy, and what I really want to do, is learn. When I graduated from Northwestern and took a job as a stress analyst at Boeing Defense, I loved it. I was learning every single day. I was watching military helicopters - my daily work - fly overhead on my walk in. How could anyone not love that?</p>

<p>But then, in late 2012, the realization that I was becoming too specialized too quickly washed over me. Less than two years into my job and I already had two patents to my name. I was useful to no more than five or six other companies in the world. And that meant that, as a 23 year old, I was immobile.</p>

<p>After some introspection, I decided to pivot away from that career to something else that I loved equally as much: programming. A year later, I realized that relegating my learning to nights and weekends wasn't going to get me a job as a programmer. I need something more.</p>

<p>So I turned to Dev Bootcamp, and learned more than I could ever have imagined was possible in nine (actually twelve - there was an optional fourth phase that I couldn't resist) weeks.</p>

<p>And now - now I am a junior developer eager (and when I say eager, I mean <em>EAGER</em> ) to continue learning as fast as my mind will allow me to learn.</p>

<h3>
<a name="my-interests" class="anchor" href="#my-interests"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Interests</h3>

<p>If my about <strong>About Me</strong> did not get this point accross, allow me to bash you over the head with it: I love learning. To that end, many of my interests involve learning or, relatedly, experiencing new things. Traveling is a great example. In 2012 I went on over two dozen trips, because I love traveling and seeing new places. I love eating at places that I've never eaten at - in fact, I tend to avoid places that I've already been once.</p>

<p>I'd rather read a book or skim the coverage of a new technology than watch TV. I'd rather build something using a raspberry pi than catch up on celebrity gossip. I'd rather solve logic problems than think about fashion. No one option is better than the other, but that's just who I am.</p>

<p>Oh, and I also love triathlons.</p>

<a name="my-skills" class="anchor" href="#my-skills"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Skills</h3>

<p>By the time you're reading this, I'm sure that I will have dramatically expanded upon my knowledge of one or more of these, if not added more to the list. However, for now bear in mind the fact that I am a beginner (albeit with the mentality of a trained engineer).</p>
